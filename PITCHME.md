# Why was I looking for a new language?
Experience of a number of languages
Mainly Java & Python
Python:
Pros - Terse code, good support for functional coding
Cons - Dynamically typed, uncompiled.
Java:
Pros - JVM provides portability, Statically Typed
Cons - Verbose, functional coding via interfaces
Learning a new language also changes the way that you use your existing language

What’s wrong with plain old Java ?
It’s verbose.
Too much ‘boilerplate’ code.
Multiple overload methods/constructors.
Runtime Errors
Null Pointers
Class Cast exceptions
Functional paradigm is still an afterthought.
Java 8 over-promised & under-delivered
Lambda functions treated as instances of interfaces

10 reasons to consider Kotlin as your next language 

100% Java Interoperability
All code compiles to pure Java byte-code
Kotlin classes can invoke methods in Java classes
Java classes can invoke Kotlin functions
Kotlin can use standard Java libraries
Many Kotlin specific libraries are available but can continue to use familiar Java libraries
Allows incremental migration to Kotlin from Java
Deploy mixed applications as a single artifact
