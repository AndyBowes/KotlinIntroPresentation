What is ‘Kotlin’?
‘New’ programming language
Developed since 2011, v1.0 released Feb 2016
Developed by JetBrains
Makers of IntelliJ & Android Studio
Runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
Open Source 
A ‘Better Java’
Named after an island in the Baltic Sea
---

Why was I looking for a new language?
Experience of a number of languages
Mainly Java & Python
Python:
Pros - Terse code, good support for functional coding
Cons - Dynamically typed, uncompiled.
Java:
Pros - JVM provides portability, Statically Typed
Cons - Verbose, functional coding via interfaces
Learning a new language also changes the way that you use your existing language
---
Characteristics of my ideal language
Runs on multiple platforms
Natively compiled or via JVM/CLR
Statically typed & compiled
Terse & productive
True support for functional programming
Wide community
Build tools (Gradle, Maven)
IDEs - IntelliJ, Eclipse
Availability of frameworks (HTTP, JSON, …)
Ability to reuse existing libraries
---
Characteristics of ideal language
Potential compiled languages
Go - Google, statically typed with garbage collection 
Rust - Mozilla, safe, concurrent systems language
Decided JVM provided better platform
Portable to more target platforms
Better instrumentation & support
Less ‘lock-in’, easier to switch to alternative language.

What’s wrong with plain old Java ?
It’s verbose.
Too much ‘boilerplate’ code.
Multiple overload methods/constructors.
Runtime Errors
Null Pointers
Class Cast exceptions
Functional paradigm is still an afterthought.
Java 8 over-promised & under-delivered
Lambda functions treated as instances of interfaces

10 reasons to consider Kotlin as your next language 

100% Java Interoperability
All code compiles to pure Java byte-code
Kotlin classes can invoke methods in Java classes
Java classes can invoke Kotlin functions
Kotlin can use standard Java libraries
Many Kotlin specific libraries are available but can continue to use familiar Java libraries
Allows incremental migration to Kotlin from Java
Deploy mixed applications as a single artifact
